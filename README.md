## About Me

I'm a game programmer and hopefully soon will be a game artist. I worked with C# and C++ from scratch and also used Unreal and Unity. 

I was raised around technology and it was only a matter of time I dabbled into it as I was a student of David Thibodaux STEM Magnet Academy. In middle school I was in the robotics club. In high school I went down the technology field and went into digital media and was exposed to coding video games. This is when I knew I wanted to be a game programmer. Then in senior year a programming class opened up. Our teacher told us about a nation wide app challenge. So in 2019 I participated in the [2019 Congressional App Challenge](https://www.klfy.com/local/congressman-higgins-announces-winners-of-the-2019-congressional-app-challenge/) as a Graphic Designer. 



By a miracle I found out about [AIE](https://aie.edu/) a technical college that teaches art and programming for games.
